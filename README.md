## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`kidney-defect-detector.ipynb`) implementing a state-of-the-art deep learning model for classifying kidney defects from CT scan images. The model leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained **ResNet50** backbone, fine-tuned on a dataset of **12,464 CT kidney scans**, to categorize images into four clinically relevant classes:

- **Normal** ‚Äì Healthy kidney tissue
- **Cyst** ‚Äì Benign fluid-filled sacs
- **Tumor** ‚Äì Malignant neoplasms
- **Stone** ‚Äì Calcifications and lithiasis

The notebook provides a complete pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and visualization, making it suitable for educational, research, and clinical applications.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **[CT-KIDNEY-DATASET-Normal-Cyst-Tumor-Stone](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone)** from Kaggle, a curated collection of annotated CT scans.

### Dataset Composition

| Class  | Count  | Proportion |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Normal | ~5,000 | 40.1%      |
| Cyst   | ~3,700 | 29.7%      |
| Tumor  | ~2,200 | 17.6%      |
| Stone  | ~1,300 | 10.4%      |
| **Total** | **12,464** | **100%** |

### Dataset Specifications

- **Format**: JPG images with metadata in `kidneyData.csv`
- **Resolution**: Standardized to 224√ó224√ó3 (RGB)
- **Train/Validation Split**: 80/20 (~9,571 training, ~2,393 validation images)
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nazmul0087/ct-kidney-dataset-normal-cyst-tumor-and-stone)
- **Attribution**: Curated by [Nazmul Hasan](https://www.kaggle.com/nazmul0087)

**Note**: A Kaggle account and API token are required for dataset access outside Kaggle environments.

## üß† Model Architecture

### Base Architecture

- **Backbone**: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet, frozen layers)
- **Input**: 224√ó224√ó3 RGB images
- **Purpose**: Feature extraction for kidney-specific patterns

```

### Training Configuration

#### Model Compilation

- **Optimizer**: Adam (learning rate: 0.0001)
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

#### Callbacks

- **Early Stopping**: Monitors validation loss with patience of 10 epochs, prevents overfitting
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces learning rate by factor of 0.2 when validation loss plateaus (patience: 5 epochs)

#### Class Weighting

- Computed dynamically to handle dataset imbalance and prevent bias toward majority classes.

## üìà Performance

The model demonstrates exceptional performance on the validation set with nearly perfect classification accuracy across all kidney pathology categories.
